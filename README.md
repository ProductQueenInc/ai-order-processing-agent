# AI Order Processing Agent
An AI-powered order processing agent that classifies customer emails, extracts product requests, matches them to a live inventory, and updates fulfillment status in Google Sheets — built entirely using prompt engineering and automation, without traditional software development (essentially, writing the code myself).

This project automates the extraction, classification, response generation, and fulfillment tracking of product orders sent via email — using prompt engineering instead of traditional software.

## 🧠 What it Does

- Classifies emails as "orders" or "inquiries"
- Parses product names and quantities
- Matches against a Google Sheets product database
- Updates a fulfillment tracker with stock levels and order status

## 🚀 Stack
- Python (Google Colab)
- OpenAI API
- Google Sheets API

## 🛠️ Setup
1. Add your OpenAI API key in the config section.
2. Link your Google Sheets document.
3. Paste your sample email content to test.
